            <h3>Admirable Qualities:</h3>
            <p>Self admiration is very important as the only person who matters in the end is ourselves,no matter how much we priortize others feelings above ours,theres always going to be someone unsatisfied with us so why not show self love and priortize the feelings which matters the most-OURS.</p>
            <p>The biggest thing a human can control,showcase or he/she is defined by is the act of feeling things deeply,ie emotions which is one of the important factors on how we are as a human,and I believe that i am one of those who feels everything on a deeper level which makes me stand out from the rest.</p>
            <p>I have good communication skills,speaking skill and writing along with my hobbies including dancing and photography and modeling,apart from only the book knowledge which might help us define academically but not stand out from the crowd when in real world so according to me,personal enhancement in other fields is also equally important.</p>
            <p>The most admirable quality that i have of mine is not only the ability to think differently but also find the positive outcomes even from the negative ones which motivates me to work even further regardless of the outcome                          (. ~. )--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    </p>
